##########################deduce clones and subclones
 As described in Brastianos
et al (36), clones and subclones were determined through Markov Chain Montecarlo sampling
using Dirichlet process Mixture Models on pre- and post-CRT mutation CCFs, which assigns
mutations to subclones without pre-specifying the number of subclones. Mutations inferred to be
in a subclone with a CCF ≥ 0.8 were described as “clonal” while those inferred to be in a
subclone with CCF < 0.8 were called “subclonal.” For each subclone, two CCFs were inferred;
one CCF in the pre-treatment tumor and CCF in the post-treatment tumor (23).
